        <h2>I've loved software for a very long time.</h2>

        <p>
          When my dad brought home a 286 in 1991, I was enthralled. I watched as
          he painstakingly typed and simultaneously repeated{" "}
          <code>cd backslash games enter</code> and saw the screen scroll and
          change. It was mind-blowing to a ten year old.
        </p>

        <p>
          A couple years later, a middle school math teacher gave me a book on
          BASIC programming, and said she had noticed I liked computers. At home,
          I discovered that our new 486DX computer had QBasic. I was in heaven.
        </p>

        <p>
          That has led to a life-long obsession with coding. The journey has taken
          me from running large excavation equipment to framing houses to 3D CAD
          design, until I eventually landed on a career in software.
